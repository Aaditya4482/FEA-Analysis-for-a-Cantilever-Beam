Cantilever Beam Deflection using Finite Element Analysis (FEA)
Overview
This project implements a Finite Element Analysis (FEA) approach to calculate the deflection and slope of a cantilever beam subjected to a uniformly distributed load. The beam is discretized into a specified number of elements, and the resulting deflection is compared with the analytical solution.

Features
Stiffness Matrix Assembly: Constructs the global stiffness matrix for the beam.
Load Vector Assembly: Assembles the global load vector based on the uniformly distributed load.
Boundary Conditions: Applies fixed boundary conditions at the first node.
Solving the System: Solves for displacements using matrix inversion.
Post-Processing: Calculates slopes and deflections at each node.
Comparison with Analytical Solution: Plots the FEA results against the analytical solution for validation.
Code Structure
The code is divided into the following sections:

Parameters: Defines the physical and geometric properties of the beam, including its length, Young's modulus, moment of inertia, and load.
Stiffness Matrix Assembly: Constructs the global stiffness matrix by assembling the element stiffness matrices.
Load Vector Assembly: Assembles the global load vector for the uniformly distributed load.
Boundary Conditions: Modifies the stiffness matrix and load vector to apply fixed boundary conditions.
Solving the System: Uses the reduced stiffness matrix and load vector to solve for the nodal displacements.
Post-Processing: Calculates the slopes and deflections at each node and compares the results with the analytical solution.
Plotting Results: Plots the FEA deflection and the analytical deflection along the beam for visual comparison.
Getting Started
To run this code, ensure you have MATLAB or an equivalent environment that supports matrix operations and plotting.

Prerequisites
MATLAB or any compatible software for running the script.
Basic knowledge of finite element methods and structural analysis.
Running the Code
Copy the code into a .m file (e.g., cantilever_beam_fea.m).
Execute the script in MATLAB or a compatible environment.
The script will output the deflection plot comparing the FEA results with the analytical solution.
Example
The provided code calculates the deflection of a cantilever beam with the following parameters:

Beam length (L): 10 m
Young's Modulus (E): 210 GPa
Moment of Inertia (I): 1.33e-4 m^4
Uniformly Distributed Load (q): 1000 N/m
Number of Elements (n): 10
The code produces a plot of deflection along the beam, showing both the FEA results and the analytical solution.
